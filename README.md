# Data Incubator Project Challenge
# Using company's evaluation and prominence on LinkedIn/Glassdoor to predict their performance

## Project Summary
I propose to build a predictive model relating how people in job seeking position view it as their potential employer to the value of the company in the market. Job seekers and employees are the people who are highly interested in the company, therefore there opinions about the company can be a sensitive predictor of how well the company will do in the future. The goal is to see whether user activities on LinkedIn and Glassdoor can predict the stock prices of the company. I will use NLP to quantify reviews and assortment of factors from LinkedIn and Glassdoor. The stock prices will be used as indicators of the company's performance. 

## Project motivation

As an active job seeker, one of my main criteria in finding the right place to work is the potential to grow. However, with the high volume of available information, and interdiscplinary-ness of the position I am looking for (which is data scientist) can become a full-time job just searching for jobs. I use many different sources of job board, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Indeed to name a few and actively search for news related to the companies that I am interested in. I have accumulated more knowledge about companies that hire data scientist during last year than rest of my life. I believe that the point of time when someone is most interested in a company is when they are looking for career opportunities and while they are working. Therefore their opinions would be a good indicator for company's growth.
